# Hello-World
A collection of my projects - some for fun, some to learn, some to succeed.
This is a brief introduction of myself.  I am very family oriented, highly inquisitive, but yet reserved. I love people, but only tolerate so much foolishness. Coding intrigues me and I want to to become proficient in a few languages and work in the digital forensic arena.
